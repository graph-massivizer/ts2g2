        Return a Natural Visibility Graph of an timeseries Time Series.

        A visibility graph converts a time series into a graph. The constructed graph
        uses integer nodes to indicate which event in the series the node represents.
        Edges are formed as follows: consider a bar plot of the series and view that
        as a side view of a landscape with a node at the top of each bar. An edge
        means that the nodes can be connected by a straight "line-of-sight" without
        being obscured by any bars between the nodes.

        The resulting graph inherits several properties of the series in its structure.
        Thereby, periodic series convert into regular graphs, random series convert
        into random graphs, and fractal series convert into scale-free networks [1]_.
